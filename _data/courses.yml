  description: The purpose of this course is to provide a deep introduction to HR and help students recognize its importance within the organization as a whole. The class will highlight the strategic dimensions of HR and approach it from more of a general management perspective. HR is especially important in knowledge-based organizations, where people are the primary resource that organizations derive value from. Managing people well is critical for modern organizations to succeed. This course will also delve into HRâ€™s role in analyzing and addressing organizational inequalities and diversity and inclusion (D&I). This course incorporates current events and case studies to highlight contemporary examples of HR processes and their consequences. Furthermore, people analytics (the combination of HR questions with data science methods) are addressed throughout the semester.
