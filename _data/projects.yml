  description: This study investigates how cultures of firms that engage in wrongdoing differ from those that do not. Our novel approach of comprehensively capturing the multifaceted nature of culture and identifying its implicit associations with deliberate wrongdoing helps develop new insights into this relationship. Specifically, we measure wrongdoing via financial restatements and litigations, and draw on employee accounts of organizational life from reviews posted on Glassdoor to measure cultural features. Using a machine-learning approach, we examine data obtained from more than 450 large US-based public firms over a six-year period. Through abductive analysis, we identify four cultural themes that are strongly associated with wrongdoing. The resulting insights aid in building and testing theory, offer warning signs for practitioners, and can guide the discovery of causal forces.

  description: Artificial intelligence is introducing significant structural and institutional changes by challenging existing laws and regulations, industry practices (e.g., standard settings), emerging organizational forms (e.g., platforms), new forms of labor (e.g., algorithmic auditors), and leadership roles (e.g., shifting authority regimes and new professional roles). In our article, we've talked about how we can harness AI's power through governance so as to help solve societal problems without amplifying existing inequalities or creating new ones. Based on a review of contemporary research, we address three fundamental governance questions - What are the sources of AI's bias and opacity? Why do we need AI to be fair and transparent? And most importantly, what can organizations and policy makers do to mitigate AI's pitfalls as they design and approve AI-based products and services?
  
- name: Duality of Purpose - When does organizational purpose align with employee experiences?

  description: The concept of purpose has been receiving significant attention in the management discourse, due to its potential to address various organizational challenges. Purpose is both a superordinate goal encompassing multiple stakeholders’ nonfinancial objectives and an internal managerial tool to foster engagement and motivation. Yet there has been limited empirical research on purpose claims, employees’ experience of purpose, and the relationship between the two. This paper investigates factors that influence employees experience of purpose and presents a systematic analysis of purpose claims and experience in large US-based public firms (S&P 500) over six years (2015–2020). It draws from Glassdoor data (textual analysis), Wayback Machine (archival data), RepRisk data, and 10-k reports. Employees of organizations that emphasize prosocial values and engage in fewer ESG violations are more likely to experience purpose, suggesting the significance of aligning corporate action with social and ethical goals. Investigating these dynamics contributes to a deeper understanding of how organizational and leaders’ actions shape individuals' experiences of purpose, ultimately informing strategies for fostering meaningful and purposeful work environments.

  description: In this working paper, I empirically measure and explore the connections between organizational purpose and corporate social performance. The study aims to investigate whether firms that possess a profound sense of purpose are more inclined to demonstrate social responsibility, while also examining the factors that influence this relationship. To assess corporate social performance, I utilize the RepRisk dataset, which captures a firm's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) violations. The preliminary findings of this study indicate that organizations whose employees experience a deep sense of purpose, i.e., widespread and sustained employee experience of purpose, display more socially responsible organizational behavior over time. Additionally, ESG violations, especially on the part of leadership, can dampen the sense of purpose experienced by employees. The results highlight how organizations’ social responsibility and purpose-driven management are co-constituted.

  description: In the final chapter of my dissertation, I conduct a qualitative study that spans four years (2017-2020), focusing on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on an ed-tech startup. In my analysis, I drew data from three primary sources - semi-structured interviews, archival sources, including fact sheets and photographs, and in-situ observations. The study's findings indicate that managers adopted creative and original methods to replicate a comparable cultural environment (as in a co-located setting), distinct from traditional solutions employed by larger incumbent organizations. Furthermore, the research indicates that the transitional phase influenced the workforce differently, based on socio-economic differences among employees. Findings from this research contribute to our understanding of the challenges faced by small enterprises in the face of radical change, particularly within the context of emerging economies.

In this work, we have been developing several algorithms that enable a JIT compiler to reason not only about the cost of applying a code tranformation (e.g., method inlining), but also about the potential future benefits (e.g., further optimizations) of applying such a code transformation.

#   description: Can program analysis help developers use crypto APIs more securely? In this work, we have been working on an end-to-end solution to detect misuses of crypto APIs that provides a DSL to define the correct uses of an API, a compiler that generates static analysis checks based on those rules, and IDE extensions that help developers detect misuses in their code based on our infrastructure.
#   impact: Most recently, our work with <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.cognicrypt" target="_blank">CogniCrypt</a> helped <a href="https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.SYMSA1460.html" target="_blank">Symantec</a> fix a bug in one of its products that could lead to privilege escalation.

#   description: Can pointer analysis be both scalable and precise? In this work, we explore how to leverage the advantages of distributive frameworks such as IFDS, IDE, and WPDS to perform scalable and precise non-distributive analyses such as pointer analysis. We have been building various on-demand pointer analyses that also encode rich alias information for the queried variables.

#   description: Can we perform whole-program analysis of a given Java application without analyzing the whole program? Through light-weight static analyses of the structure of a given application, we have shown that the answer to this question is 'yes'. Moreover, we developed Averroes, a placeholder library generator that enables the use of that suite in any Java whole-program analysis framework. Using Averroes reduces the amount of code that needs to be analyzed by up to 600x, improving the performance of call graph analysis as it becomes up to 7x faster, and uses up to 6x less memory.
#   impact: Averroes is currently used by the major Java static analysis frameworks, <a href="https://github.com/Sable/soot/wiki/Extensions-to-Soot" target="_blank">Soot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wala/WALA/wiki/WALA-Based-Tools" target="_blank">WALA</a>, and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/yanniss/doop" target="_blank">DOOP</a>.

#   description: Is analyzing the Scala source code any different than analyzing the JVM bytecodes that the Scala compiler generates? In this work, we developed ScalaCG, a collection of low-cost call graph analyses that target the Scala source code and support various Scala features such as traits, abstract type members, closures, and path-dependent types. Using ScalaCG produces call graphs that are up to 19x more precise than using a bytecode-based approach in terms of call edges and reachable nodes.
#   impact: ScalaCG was awarded a Distinguished Artifact Award at the European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP) in 2014. Scalacg has been extended by the original Scala research group at EPFL to improve call graph precision and decrease analysis time for non-trivial Scala programs. These extensions are integrated in the upcoming Scala Dotty compiler.
