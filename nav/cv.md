As a doctoral candidate in the Department of Business Administration at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, I aim to graduate with a major in Organizational Theory and a minor in Strategy. I am a proud recipient of the [AAUW fellowship](https://www.aauw.org/resources/programs/fellowships-grants/){:target="_blank"} for the academic year 2021-2022.

My research draws on my professional experience where I spent five years working with Credit Suisse AG, Schlumberger Ltd., and 9.9 Education. 

I received my bachelors in computer science engineering and masters in economics from [BITS Pilani University](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, and learnt about the wonderful world of liberal arts at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/){:target="_blank"}.

<!-- Just before moving to Germany, I finished my Ph.D. studies under the supervision of [Ondřej Lhoták](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~olhotak/){:target="_blank"} in the [Programming Languages Group](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Waterloo. You can find my thesis: **The Separate Compilation Assumption** [here](http://hdl.handle.net/10012/8835){:target="_blank"}.

Prior to that, I received my MMath degree at the University of Waterloo in 2010 when I was part of the Security Research Group led by [Raouf Boutaba](http://rboutaba.cs.uwaterloo.ca/index.html){:target="_blank"}.
